## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
a <- 2
3 -> b
```

```{r}
c <- 4

65 + b

a + 1

```

```{r}
c + 5


`心好累` <- 100
```

# numeric class
```{r}
class(a)
```

```{r}
a<-5
a2<-5L
class(a)
class(a2)
```

```{r}
aVector<-c(5,6,7)
a2Vector<-c(5L,6L,7L)
class(aVector)
class(a2Vector)
```
